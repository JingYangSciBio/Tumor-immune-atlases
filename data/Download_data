The six single-cell transcriptomics datasets analyzed in this study are publicly available through their original publications. 
Specifically, the Bi et al. dataset was downloaded from 
https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1288/tumor-and-immune-reprogramming-during-immunotherapy-in-advanced-renal-cell-carcinoma#study-download. 
The Jerby-Arnon et al. dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE115978. 
The datasets from Yost et al., Liu et al., Sade-Feldman et al., and Caushi et al. are available under GEO accession numbers GSE123814, GSE179994, GSE120575, and GSE176021, respectively.
